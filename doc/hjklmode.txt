1. Introduction                                          *hjklmode-introduction*

Vimâ€™s popularity is largely due to its ability to increase productivity through
efficient navigation and editing techniques. One such technique is HJKL
navigation, which allows using the H, J, K, and L keys to move the cursor left,
down, up, and right. This method of navigation may seem strange at first, but
it is actually a very efficient way to navigate through text and can greatly
increase productivity when using Vim.

The Vim plugin Hjklmode can be used to:
- Learn HJKL navigation: Hjklmode forces you to learn HJKL navigation as it
  disables certain keys that require moving the hand away from the Touch Typing
  position, which can disrupt typing flow. These keys include: Backspace,
  Arrows, Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up and Page Down.
- Add HJKL navigation to other modes than Normal Mode: Hjklmode adds the
  key mappings \<Alt>+hjkl to Insert Mode, Command Mode, and Terminal Mode.

Hjklmode does not disable the Escape key by default. It can be disabled with
the option `let g:hjklmode_disable_escape = 1` . It is important to note that
Hjklmode ignores the option `g:hjklmode_disable_escape` when Vim is
executed in a terminal or on the Windows operating system.

Hjklmode adds key mappings for <Alt>+hjkl which allows using HJKL navigation
Insert Mode, Command Mode, and Terminal Mode.

It works well in Vim GUI mode (gvim), but does not always work when Vim is
executed in a terminal. You can make the key mappings <Alt>+hjkl work in
terminal mode by making sure that the terminal does not grab the <Alt> key and
by installing the Vim plugin: https://github.com/drmikehenry/vim-fixkey .
